You have a dictionary representing student grades in various subjects. Write a Python program to calculate the average grade for each student.
Sample Dictionary: grades = {'John': [85, 90, 88], 'Alice': [75, 80, 82], 'Bob': [92, 88, 90]}
Sample Output: John: 87.67, Alice: 79.00, Bob: 90.00
grades = {}
num_students = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))
for i in range(num_students):
    student_name = input(f"Enter the name of student {i+1}: ")
    student_grades = input(f"Enter the grades for {student_name} (comma-separated): ").split(',')
    student_grades = [int(grade.strip()) for grade in student_grades]  # Convert grades to integers
    grades[student_name] = student_grades
average_grades = {student: sum(grades) / len(grades) for student, grades in grades.items()}
print("Average grades:")
for student, avg_grade in average_grades.items():
    print(f"{student}: {avg_grade:.2f}")
Sample Output :
Enter the number of students: 3
Enter the name of student 1: John
Enter the grades for John (comma-separated): 85, 90, 88
Enter the name of student 2: Alice
Enter the grades for Alice (comma-separated): 75, 80, 82
Enter the name of student 3: Bob
Enter the grades for Bob (comma-separated): 92, 88, 90
Average grades:
John: 87.67
Alice: 79.00
Bob: 90.00
