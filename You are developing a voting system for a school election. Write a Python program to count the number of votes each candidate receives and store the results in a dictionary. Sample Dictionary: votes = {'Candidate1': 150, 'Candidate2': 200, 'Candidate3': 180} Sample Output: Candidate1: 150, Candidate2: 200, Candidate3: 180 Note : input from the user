You are developing a voting system for a school election. Write a Python program to count the number of votes each candidate receives and store the results in a dictionary.
Sample Dictionary: votes = {'Candidate1': 150, 'Candidate2': 200, 'Candidate3': 180}
Sample Output: Candidate1: 150, Candidate2: 200, Candidate3: 180
Note : input from the user
votes = {}
num_candidates = int(input("Enter the number of candidates: "))

for i in range(1, num_candidates + 1):
    candidate_name = input(f"Enter the name of candidate {i}: ")
    vote_count = int(input(f"Enter the number of votes for {candidate_name}: "))
    votes[candidate_name] = vote_count
print("Dictionary of votes:", votes)

print("Output:")
for candidate, count in votes.items():
    print(f"{candidate}: {count}")
Sample Output :
Enter the number of candidates: 3
Enter the name of candidate 1: Candidate1
Enter the number of votes for Candidate1: 150
Enter the name of candidate 2: Candidate2
Enter the number of votes for Candidate2: 200
Enter the name of candidate 3: Candidate3
Enter the number of votes for Candidate3: 180

Dictionary of votes: {'Candidate1': 150, 'Candidate2': 200, 'Candidate3': 180}
Output:
Candidate1: 150
Candidate2: 200
Candidate3: 180
