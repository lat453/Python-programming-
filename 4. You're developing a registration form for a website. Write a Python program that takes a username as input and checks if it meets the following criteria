You're developing a registration form for a website. Write a Python program that takes a username as input and checks if it meets the following criteria:
Contains only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers)
Starts with a letter
Is between 6 and 12 characters long

def check_username(username):
   
    if len(username) < 6 or len(username) > 12:
        return False
  
    if not username[0].isalpha():
        return False
    if not username.isalnum():
        return False
    
    return True

username = input("Enter your username: ")

if check_username(username):
    print("Username is valid.")
else:
    print("Username is not valid.")
