Create a Python program that takes a sentence as input and returns the longest word in the sentence. If there are multiple longest words, return the first one encountered.
def longest_word(input_sentence):
   
    words = input_sentence.split() 
    longest_word = ""
    max_length = 0
   
    for word in words:
       
        word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())
        if len(word) > max_length:
            longest_word = word
            max_length = len(word)
    
    return longest_word


input_sentence = "This is a sample sentence with multiple words"
print(longest_word(input_sentence))
