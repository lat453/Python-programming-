You're developing a password strength checker tool. Write a Python function that takes a password as input and checks its strength. Print messages indicating whether the password is weak, medium, or strong based on the following criteria:
Weak: Less than 6 characters long
Medium: Between 6 and 10 characters long
Strong: More than 10 characters long

def password_strength(password):
    length = len(password)
    
    if length < 6:
        print("Weak: Password is less than 6 characters long.")
    elif 6 <= length <= 10:
        print("Medium: Password is between 6 and 10 characters long.")
    else:
        print("Strong: Password is more than 10 characters long.")


password = input("Enter your password: ")
password_strength(password)
