You are developing a movie recommendation system. Write a Python program to recommend movies to a user based on their preferences stored in a dictionary.
Sample Dictionary: preferences = {'Action': ['The Dark Knight', 'Inception'], 'Comedy': ['The Hangover', 'Superbad']}
Sample Output: Recommendations: ['The Dark Knight', 'Inception']
preferences = {}
num_genres = int(input("Enter the number of genres: "))
for _ in range(num_genres):
    genre = input("Enter the genre: ")
    movies = input(f"Enter the movies for {genre} (comma-separated): ").split(',')
    preferences[genre] = [movie.strip() for movie in movies]
user_preferences = input("Enter your movie preferences (comma-separated): ").split(',')
recommendations = []
for genre, movies in preferences.items():
    recommended_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie not in user_preferences]
    recommendations.extend(recommended_movies)


print("Recommendations:", recommendations)
Sample Output :
Enter the number of genres: 2
Enter the genre: Action
Enter the movies for Action (comma-separated): The Dark Knight, Inception
Enter the genre: Comedy
Enter the movies for Comedy (comma-separated): The Hangover, Superbad
Enter your movie preferences (comma-separated): Inception, The Hangover
Recommendations: ['The Dark Knight', 'Superbad']
